## The importance of epistasis
Biochemical analyses routinely demonstrate that genes interact in complex networks and pathways to generate chemical products necessary for development. However, the importance of these **epistatic** interactions with respect to quantitative traits remains unknown. This is despite the enormous amount of research, both theoretical and empirical, that has been devoted to gaining a better understanding of the phenomenon. One of the primary reasons that epistasis is poorly understood is that unlike when testing the effect of variants at individual loci, testing the effects of specific combinations of variants at multiple loci scales much more rapidly than the number of loci being tested. This quickly generates a lack of statistical power, and is often referred to as the *"small n, large p"* problem. Our lab is interested in developing and applying methods to avoid this problem by reducing the space of parameters that we are interested in testing. On the left, we demonstrate as an example one approach we have taken to achieve this, which involved looking for selection on particular epistatic combinations by limiting our search space to only linked cases of epistasis. In the figure shown, dashed lines represent connections between distinct loci that are putatively epistatic.

## Genomic prediction
Techniques such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and genomic selection (a.k.a genomic prediction) all focus on relating genotypes and phenotypes is present-day populations. Conversely, selection-mapping and/or scans for selection focus on identifying loci that were historically important during past selection, without necessarily incorporating any phenotypic information. Therefore, results from selection mapping and other evolutionary studies represent independent information that may prove beneficial when incorporated into a genomic-prediction framework. We are working to develop and implement methods to accelerate plant (and animal) improvement by incorporating evidence of **past selection** into prediction models that emphasize **present genotype-phenotype relationships** to develop **better populations in the future**.
