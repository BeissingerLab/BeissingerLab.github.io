Each week, the DETOX group meets to discuss the latest papers in evolutionary genetics at the [Craft Beer Cellar](http://www.craftbeercellar.com/columbia/){:target="_blank"}, in Downtown Columbia. After a week of doing science for work, we can all benefit from the chance to "detoxify" our systems by talking over a paper in a fun, no-pressure setting. Papers cover all aspects of evolutionary genetics, giving us the chance to stay up-to-date on the literature in our own and related fields.

Regular attendance isn't mandatory, just come when you can and/or when the paper interests you. Attendees do not need to be members or affiliates of the Beissinger Lab, just scientists at any stage of their careers who are interested in the topics and papers we'll discuss.

Our meeting schedule is being determined, but will be posted here shortly. Expect a weekly early-evening schedule.

Email paper nominations to Tim, and I'll work them into the schedule below.
