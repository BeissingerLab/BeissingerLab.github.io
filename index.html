Welcome to the Beissinger Lab. We study plant quantitative and population genetics to better understand how plants have evolved in the past, how phenotypes and genotypes are related in the present, and how these sets of information can be used for plant improvement in the future. Our research is focussed on the maize (corn) genome. Our primary interests fall into two categories: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> We  are interested in understanding how organisms respond to evolutionary
  forces such as artificial selection. </li>
  <li> We are working to achieve an improved understanding of complexities
  of genotype-phenotype relationships such as interactions and
  non-additivity.</li>
</ol>
<p> We are supported by the <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/main.htm" target="_blank"> USDA-ARS </a>
  at the <a href="http://www.missouri.edu" target="_blank"> University
  of Missouri, Columbia. </a>
