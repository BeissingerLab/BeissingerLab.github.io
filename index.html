<p>
Welcome to the Beissinger Lab. We are interested in plant
  quantitative and population genetic methods and applications. Our
  research is focussed on the maize (corn) genome. Our primary
  interests fall into two categories: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> We  are interested in understanding how organisms respond to evolutionary
  forces such as artificial selection. </li>
  <li> We are working to achieve an improved understanding of complexities
  of genotype-phenotype relationships such as interactions and
  non-additivity.</li>
</ol>
<p> We are supported by the <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/main.htm" target="_blank"> USDA-ARS </a>
  at the <a href="http://www.missouri.edu" target="_blank"> University
  of Missouri, Columbia. </a>
