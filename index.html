Welcome to the Beissinger Lab. We are interested in plant
  quantitative and population genetic methods and applications. Our
  research is focussed on the maize (corn) genome. Our primary
  interests fall into two categories: 

1) We  are interested in understanding how plants respond to evolutionary
  forces such as artificial selection, and
2) We are working to achieve an improved understanding of complexities
  in the genotype-phenotype relationship such as interactions and non-additivity.
  We are supported by the <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/main.htm" target="_blank"> USDA-ARS </a>
  at the <a href="http://www.missouri.edu" target="_blank"> University
  of Missouri, Columbia. </a>
